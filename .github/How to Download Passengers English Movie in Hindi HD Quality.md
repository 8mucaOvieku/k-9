## Passengers (English) Movie Plot Summary
  
The movie follows Jim Preston (Chris Pratt), a mechanical engineer who is one of the 5,258 passengers on board the Starship Avalon, a spaceship that is traveling to a new planet called Homestead II. The journey takes 120 years, so the passengers and crew are put into hibernation pods to sleep through the trip. However, due to a malfunction caused by a meteor strike, Jim's pod opens 90 years before the scheduled arrival. He finds himself alone on the ship, with only an android bartender named Arthur (Michael Sheen) for company.
  
After a year of loneliness and despair, Jim becomes fascinated by another passenger, Aurora Lane (Jennifer Lawrence), a journalist and writer. He accesses her personal files and falls in love with her. He faces a moral dilemma: whether to wake her up and doom her to the same fate as him, or leave her alone and respect her life. He eventually decides to wake her up, but lies to her that her pod also malfunctioned.

They also discover that the ship is suffering from more malfunctions that threaten their lives and the lives of the other passengers.
